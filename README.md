# nodejs-nhl
NodeJS &amp; ExpressJS webapp to fetch and parse NHL data. Looks pretty plain but does what it promises. By default this shows today's data and a couple days before but it can be easily adjusted to your liking. Links to video streams are disabled for now but there's a feature to fetch those too..
